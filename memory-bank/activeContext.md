**Last Updated**: 2025-01-31

## Current Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Full implementation of To-Do List web application with celebration feature
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Memory Bank documentation established retroactively

## Recent Completed Work

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- âœ… Semantic HTML structure with accessibility attributes
- âœ… Modern CSS styling with responsive design and animations
- âœ… Core JavaScript functionality (add, delete, toggle tasks)
- âœ… Local storage persistence implementation

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Completed)  
- âœ… Celebration animation with confetti when all tasks completed
- âœ… Custom checkbox styling with smooth transitions
- âœ… Empty state management with friendly messaging
- âœ… Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + / to focus input)

### Phase 3: Git Structure (Completed)
- âœ… Clean commit history with 4 logical, incremental commits
- âœ… Conventional commit message format with proper scopes
- âœ… Feature branch created for pull request workflow

## Current Challenge
ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Creating pull request for deployment

**Issue**: GitHub token lacks `public_repo` permissions for PR creation
**Status**: Repository exists and is public, feature branch pushed
**Next Steps**: Resolve token permissions and create PR

## Technical Implementation Highlights
- **Architecture**: Clean OOP design with TodoApp class
- **Security**: XSS protection via HTML escaping
- **Performance**: Efficient DOM updates and automatic cleanup
- **UX**: Smooth animations and micro-interactions

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Resolve GitHub token permissions issue
2. **Deploy**: Create pull request and merge to main
3. **Future**: Consider additional features like task categories, due dates, or data export

## Key Decisions Made
- Vanilla JavaScript chosen for simplicity and performance
- localStorage used for data persistence (no backend required)
- Celebration feature adds delightful user experience
- Responsive-first design approach

## Notes
- Project follows user's coding standards and git workflow preferences
- All commits are atomic and represent complete functionality
- Code is production-ready with proper error handling
